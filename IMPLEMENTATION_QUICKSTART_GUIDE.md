---

## 🎯 DECISION REQUIRED

**You must choose ONE implementation approach:**

### ☑️ RECOMMENDED: Hybrid Approach (8 weeks, $227K)
**What you get:**
- Week 4: Production deployment (93→95/100 readiness)
- Week 4: 12 tax agents + improved UI/UX
- Week 8: 8 accounting agents + 3 orchestrators + desktop MVP
- Result: 75% of both UI/UX and AI platform

**Why choose this:**
- ✅ Balanced risk/reward
- ✅ Dual revenue streams (SMB + Enterprise)
- ✅ 20% cost savings vs single track
- ✅ Fastest time to production (Week 4)

### Alternative Options:

**Option A: UI/UX Only (4 weeks, $272K)**
- 100% UI/UX, 0% AI agents
- Desktop app complete
- Better for consumer/SMB markets

**Option B: AI Agents Only (12 weeks, $272K)**
- 100% AI agents (37 total), minimal UI
- Better for enterprise/B2B markets

**Option C: Complete Track 3 Only (10 hours, $5K)**
- Just finish performance work
- Stable foundation, no new features

## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATION

### Top 5 Risks

**1. Team Context Switching (HIGH)**
- Risk: Productivity loss switching between UI and agents
- Mitigation: Mon-Wed UI, Thu-Fri integration testing

**2. Agent Complexity (MEDIUM-HIGH)**
- Risk: Tax agents more complex than estimated
- Mitigation: Start with hardest first (EU/US/UK), 20% buffer

**3. Gemini API Limits (MEDIUM)**
- Risk: API quota exceeded
- Mitigation: Request increase, caching, local fallback

**4. Desktop Scope Creep (MEDIUM)**
- Risk: Features expand beyond MVP
- Mitigation: Strict MVP definition, move extras to Phase 2

**5. Integration Testing (MEDIUM)**
- Risk: Complex integration issues
- Mitigation: Continuous integration, hourly tests, dedicated QA

---

## 💡 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

### ✅ DO THIS
1. **Start with Track 3** (10 hours) - Get to 95/100 readiness first
2. **Choose Hybrid Approach** - Best balance of risk/reward
3. **Follow Week 1 checklist exactly** - Proven patterns
4. **Enforce quality gates** - Don't deploy if criteria unmet
5. **Daily standups** - Communication is critical

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS
1. **Don't skip Track 3** - Need stable foundation
2. **Don't modify hybrid plan without analysis** - Optimized already
3. **Don't cut testing** - 80% coverage is minimum
4. **Don't add scope** - Strict MVP for desktop app
5. **Don't skip daily standups** - Blockers escalate fast
