# Dependency Freeze Notes

- Current `pnpm-lock.yaml` checksum: `5f3f4e03ba5f9978352b1672e48fddd1ce42419067b233bada84c7e5e9f8759e` (captured via `sha256sum pnpm-lock.yaml`).
- Renovate and Dependabot are temporarily configured to ignore npm package updates so the refactor can proceed against a stable dependency graph.
- Once the refactor concludes, remove the ignore rules and verify the lockfile hash again before re-enabling bot upgrades.
