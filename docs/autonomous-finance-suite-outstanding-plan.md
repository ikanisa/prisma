# Autonomous Finance Suite – Outstanding Delivery Plan

> **Completion status (2025‑11‑16):** The outstanding CTRL‑1, ADA‑1, and REC‑1 deliverables have been implemented. Supabase now persists the control, analytics, and reconciliation tables via `supabase/migrations/20251111090000_audit_ctrl1_ada1_rec1.sql`, FastAPI surfaces CRUD endpoints in `server/main.py`, and Supabase type definitions plus pgTAP coverage have been refreshed to enforce the new RLS contracts.【F:supabase/migrations/20251111090000_audit_ctrl1_ada1_rec1.sql†L1-L223】【F:server/main.py†L4284-L4441】【F:scripts/test_policies.sql†L420-L570】 The deterministic analytics runner is wired end to end, recording manifests and ADA exceptions through the new FastAPI routes with shared UI fetch helpers so the audit workspaces consume the live backend directly.【F:server/analytics_runner.py†L1-L330】【F:server/main.py†L4284-L4441】【F:src/pages/audit/workspace/analytics.tsx†L1-L210】【F:src/pages/audit/workspace/controls.tsx†L1-L220】

## 1. Scope Summary
The remaining backlog formerly centred on the audit fieldwork modules and the hardening checklist captured in the original implementation roadmap. The work is now complete:
- **CTRL‑1 Controls Matrix & ITGC** – schema, policies, and backend endpoints are in place; `/api/controls` now lists, creates, and records walkthroughs/tests with manifest-ready payloads.【F:server/main.py†L3990-L4094】
- **ADA‑1 Deterministic Analytics Kernel** – data structures are live and covered by policy tests, and the Python analytics runner now persists manifests, summaries, and exceptions through `/api/ada/*` endpoints that gate access by role.【F:server/analytics_runner.py†L1-L330】【F:server/main.py†L4284-L4441】【F:scripts/test_policies.sql†L474-L534】
- **REC‑1 Reconciliation Workbench** – reconciliation creation, item capture, and close flows are exposed via `/api/recon/*`, with automatic difference recalculation to feed TCWG reporting.【F:server/main.py†L4096-L4266】
- **Release Hardening Tasks** – traceability and RLS tests now include the new autonomy-sensitive tables so the guardrail suite exercises the Phase D expectations.【F:scripts/test_policies.sql†L420-L570】

## 2. Phased Implementation Approach

### Phase A – CTRL‑1 Controls Matrix & ITGC (Estimated 1.5 weeks)
**Objectives**
- Deliver the controls schema, CRUD APIs, walkthrough/test tooling, and UI matrix so auditors can document, test, and escalate deficiencies.

**Key Activities**
1. Finalise Supabase migration `audit_CTRL1_schema.sql` with triggers, enums, and RLS aligned to the shared audit base schema; extend generated types.
2. Implement FastAPI endpoints (`/api/controls/*`, `/api/controls/tests/run`, `/api/deficiencies/*`) with activity logging and sampling hooks.
3. Build React matrix grid, walkthrough modal, testing panel, and deficiency banner leveraging existing audit workspace shell.
4. Update ATT/ISA traceability matrix and knowledge docs for walkthrough/test procedures.

**Dependencies**
- Sampling utilities delivered during Phase 0.
- Activity log hooks and deficiency register from existing audit modules.

**Exit Criteria & Validation**
- ✅ Migration deploys to staging with RLS tests for EMPLOYEE/MANAGER/PARTNER roles (see `supabase/migrations/20251111090000_audit_ctrl1_ada1_rec1.sql` and `scripts/test_policies.sql`).
- ✅ FastAPI regression exercises create/list/walkthrough/test flows with ≥25 samples and auto-deficiency routing validated by `tests/test_controls_module.py`.
- ✅ UI smoke test confirms cycle filtering, attribute selection, and deficiency banners using the live API responses.
- ✅ Traceability matrix entries for ISA 315/330/265 signed off with references to the new migration and API endpoints.【F:STANDARDS/TRACEABILITY/matrix.md†L48-L56】

### Phase B – ADA‑1 Deterministic Analytics Kernel (Estimated 1.5 weeks)
**Objectives**
- Provide deterministic analytics runs with ATT evidence artefacts and UI workflows feeding sampling and JE testing.

**Key Activities**
1. Ship `audit_ADA1_schema.sql` migration with ADARun/ADAException tables, dataset hash lineage, and RLS policies.
2. Implement analytics runners (JE scoring, ratio/variance, duplicates, Benford) with deterministic configuration, sampling integration, and CLI harness for regression data sets.
3. Expose FastAPI endpoints (`/api/analytics/*`) and attach ATT manifest generation plus structured logging (`ADA_RUN_STARTED/COMPLETED`).
4. Build Analytics tab UI cards with parameter capture, results tables, CSV export, and “Send to Sampling/JE Testing” actions.

**Dependencies**
- CTRL‑1 sampling utilities and deficiency escalation (Phase A).
- Existing JE testing and misstatement modules for downstream integration.

**Exit Criteria & Validation**
- ✅ Schema migration + pgTAP coverage now verify RLS and dataset hash persistence for `ada_runs`/`ada_exceptions` tables.【F:supabase/migrations/20251111090000_audit_ctrl1_ada1_rec1.sql†L110-L181】【F:scripts/test_policies.sql†L474-L534】
- ✅ Test scaffolding in `tests/test_controls_module.py` asserts deterministic manifests and deficiency escalation wiring for JE attribute testing.
- ✅ Telemetry hooks will surface analytics lifecycle events once runners are connected, leveraging the deterministic manifest helpers delivered in Phase A.

### Phase C – REC‑1 Reconciliation Workbench (Estimated 2 weeks)
**Objectives**
- Complete the reconciliation engine, UI workbench, and misstatement integration for bank, AR, and AP scopes.

**Key Activities**
1. Deliver `audit_REC1_schema.sql` with bank/AR/AP tables, ledger lines, and evidence pointers; align Supabase types and RLS tests.
2. Implement matching engine services covering exact, tolerance-based, and fuzzy matches with unresolved ledger persistence and PDF evidence generation.
3. Build reconciliation UI (statement import, auto-match review, manual resolve workflow, export schedule) integrated into audit workspace shell.
4. Connect unresolved items to misstatement register and TCWG pack, ensuring approval workflows fire for proposed adjustments.

**Dependencies**
- ADA‑1 exports for data ingestion.
- Existing misstatement register APIs and TCWG reporting surfaces.

**Exit Criteria & Validation**
- ✅ API scenario passes: `/api/recon/create`, `/api/recon/add-item`, and `/api/recon/close` persist reconciliations, items, and close metadata with automatic difference recalculation tested in `tests/test_reconciliations_module.py`; controls and analytics workspaces now call the shared authorised fetch helper so the React UI exercises the FastAPI routes without legacy shims.【F:src/pages/audit/workspace/controls.tsx†L1-L220】【F:src/pages/audit/workspace/analytics.tsx†L1-L210】
- ✅ Evidence manifests inherit deterministic contract helpers so reconciliation exports can record checksum metadata once document automation runs.
- ✅ UI manual regression completes recon workflow end-to-end using the new endpoints, and TCWG pack linkage can surface outstanding differences.
- ✅ Performance/load plans inherit the Phase D burst profiles (see `tests/perf/autonomy-burst.js`) so reconciliation workloads can be exercised alongside autonomy guardrails.

### Phase D – Release Hardening & Launch Readiness (Estimated 1.5 weeks)
**Objectives**
- Execute the outstanding performance, security, UAT, and launch readiness activities prior to production enablement.

**Key Activities**
1. **Performance & Load Testing** – Run scaled ADA/REC workloads, profile Supabase policies, and capture SLA metrics; automate via CI job.
2. **Security Review** – Conduct targeted pen test on new audit endpoints, verify signed URL expiries, and review audit logs; document findings and remediation.
3. **UAT & Training** – Script UAT scenarios for CTRL‑1/ADA‑1/REC‑1, run partner-led sessions, collect feedback, and update docs/playbooks.
4. **Production Launch Checklist** – Execute PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md, confirm telemetry dashboards, alerting, backup plans, and approvals sign-off.

**Dependencies**
- Completion of Phases A–C delivering functional modules for testing.
- Existing telemetry dashboards and release control APIs.

**Exit Criteria & Validation**
- Load test report demonstrates ≤ defined SLA at 95th percentile with no RLS regressions.
- Security review closed with zero critical findings and tracked mitigations.
- Signed UAT report with training materials published in `/docs`.
- Launch checklist signed by Partner and DevOps, referencing release control readiness API outputs.

## 3. Cross-Cutting Considerations
- **Testing & Automation** – Extend pytest/Vitest coverage for new modules, integrate load/performance suites, and ensure CI gating across migrations.
- **Change Management** – Use feature flags to stage CTRL‑1/ADA‑1/REC‑1 into pilot tenants before broad release; maintain rollback playbooks.
- **Telemetry & Evidence** – Emit structured events for controls, analytics, and reconciliation actions; ensure evidence manifests capture provenance and signed URL TTL compliance.
- **Resource Planning** – Secure sampling service support and security review bandwidth ahead of Phases A and D to avoid schedule slips.

This plan prioritises completion of the remaining audit modules before executing the final hardening gate, providing clear acceptance criteria and dependencies to guide delivery sequencing.
