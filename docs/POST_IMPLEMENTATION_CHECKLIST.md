## üîç Recommended Validation Steps

### 1. Local Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Run type checking
pnpm run typecheck

# Run tests (requires Vitest to be properly installed)
pnpm test tests/web-search-utils.test.ts
pnpm test tests/web-search-endpoint.test.ts

# Run linting
pnpm run lint
```

### 2. Integration Testing

- [ ] Test the endpoint with a real API call
- [ ] Verify domain filtering works correctly
- [ ] Test user location with timezone
- [ ] Test external_web_access parameter (true/false)
- [ ] Verify citation extraction from responses
- [ ] Verify source extraction and deduplication
- [ ] Test with various models (gpt-5, gpt-4o, etc.)

### 3. Manual API Testing

#### Test Basic Search
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/agent/domain-tools/web-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "orgSlug": "test-org",
    "agentKey": "auditExecution",
    "query": "What are the latest IFRS amendments?"
  }'
```

#### Test with Domain Filtering
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/agent/domain-tools/web-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "orgSlug": "test-org",
    "agentKey": "advisory",
    "query": "Latest medical research on diabetes",
    "allowedDomains": ["pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov", "clinicaltrials.gov"]
  }'
```

#### Test with Location and Timezone
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/agent/domain-tools/web-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "orgSlug": "test-org",
    "agentKey": "advisory",
    "query": "Best restaurants near me",
    "location": {
      "country": "GB",
      "city": "London",
      "region": "London",
      "timezone": "Europe/London"
    }
  }'
```

#### Test Cache-Only Mode
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/agent/domain-tools/web-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "orgSlug": "test-org",
    "agentKey": "advisory",
    "query": "Sunrise time in Paris",
    "externalWebAccess": false
  }'
```

### 4. Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Review type definitions for completeness
- [ ] Review utility functions for correctness
- [ ] Review endpoint changes for security
- [ ] Review test coverage for adequacy
- [ ] Review documentation for clarity
- [ ] Check for any TODOs or FIXMEs
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data is logged
- [ ] Ensure error handling is robust

### 5. Performance Testing

- [ ] Test with large domain lists (up to 20)
- [ ] Test with long queries
- [ ] Measure response times
- [ ] Check memory usage
- [ ] Test concurrent requests

### 6. Security Review

- [ ] Verify domain filtering prevents malicious inputs
- [ ] Check for injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify authentication is required
- [ ] Ensure proper error messages (no information leakage)
- [ ] Test rate limiting behavior

### 7. Documentation Review

- [ ] Verify all examples work
- [ ] Check for broken links
- [ ] Ensure examples use correct API endpoints
- [ ] Verify code snippets are syntactically correct
- [ ] Check that examples follow best practices

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Merge approved PR
- [ ] Tag release version
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan

### Deployment

- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run smoke tests in staging
- [ ] Monitor for errors/warnings
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor production metrics

### Post-Deployment
