# OAuth Scope Minimization

Request only the OAuth scopes necessary for the task at hand. Excess scopes increase exposure if tokens are compromised.

- Prefer read-only scopes where possible.
- Avoid broad scopes that grant administrative access.
- Regularly review third-party apps and revoke unused permissions.
