# Data Retention Policy

The organization retains operational data for defined windows to meet regulatory and business obligations:

- **User data**: 30 days after account deletion.
- **Audit logs**: 90 days.
- **Backups**: 14 days.

Data beyond these windows is automatically purged unless legal requirements dictate longer retention.
