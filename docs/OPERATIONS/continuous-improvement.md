# Continuous Improvement Backlog Process

## Source of Truth
- Jira project `OPS` for operational enhancements.
- Weekly ops meeting reviews backlog status; Eng Manager adjusts priorities.

## Intake
1. Capture new ideas in `OPS` with tags (`observability`, `automation`, `cost`, `regulatory`).
2. Link supporting evidence (incident postmortem, customer feedback, runbook gaps).

## Grooming
- Weekly: triage items, ensure clear acceptance criteria.
- Monthly: select OKR-aligned initiatives.

## Execution
- Assign owner and due date; update when shipped.
- Reflect meaningful updates in `docs/PHASE5/production-operations-runbook.md` if cadence/tooling changes.

## Review
- Quarterly retrospective: close stale items, document wins, feed into next planning cycle.
