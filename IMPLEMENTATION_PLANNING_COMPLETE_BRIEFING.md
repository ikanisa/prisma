## ⚠️ TOP RISKS & MITIGATION

### **1. Timeline Slippage (70% probability)**
**Mitigation:** Daily standups, P0 focus, 10% buffer built-in, ready to descope P3/P4

### **2. Agent Accuracy Issues (60% probability)**
**Mitigation:** Domain expert review, extensive testing, gradual rollout, human-in-the-loop

### **3. Performance Degradation (50% probability)**
**Mitigation:** Benchmarks at each milestone, aggressive caching, load testing, auto-scaling

### **4. API Rate Limits/Costs (40% probability)**
**Mitigation:** Rate limiting, caching, monitoring, fallback to local models

### **5. Data Migration Failures (20% probability)**
**Mitigation:** Rollback scripts, staging tests, backups, gradual migration
