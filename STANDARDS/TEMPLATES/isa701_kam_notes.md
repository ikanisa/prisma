# ISA 701 KAM Drafting Notes Template

Use this template as a working paper note when drafting Key Audit Matters. Adapt tone to engagement specifics; avoid boilerplate copied verbatim across clients.

## 1. Matter Overview
- **Heading**: `<Concise matter title>` (e.g., "Revenue recognition for long-term contracts").
- **Financial statement area**: `<IFRS/GAAP line item>`
- **Why it matters**: `Summarize significance (risk of material misstatement, estimation uncertainty, complexity).` Reference candidate ID.

## 2. How We Addressed the Matter
- **Primary procedures**: Link to planned procedures (`audit_planned_procedures`), include ISA references.
- **Tailoring**: Describe how procedures were tailored to the engagement circumstances.
- **Key evidence**: Reference `audit_evidence` or `documents` IDs; include brief context (e.g., "WP-05 revenue analytics").

## 3. Results and Outcomes
- **Findings**: Provide neutral summary (no opinion duplication); include whether misstatements were identified.
- **Conclusion reference**: State linkage to overall audit opinion; avoid implying separate opinions.

## 4. Communications
- **Those charged with governance**: Note date and medium of communication.
- **Management representations**: Reference relevant rep letter paragraphs if applicable.

## 5. Partner Sign-off Checklist
- [ ] Draft reviewed for ISA 701 requirements (matter significance, response description, outcome).
- [ ] Cross-references validated (risk/estimate/GC, procedures, evidence).
- [ ] Language checked for clarity and non-boilerplate.
- [ ] Approval workflow initiated (`READY_FOR_REVIEW`).

## Tone and Style Guidance
- Use active voice and specific references (e.g., "We evaluated..." rather than "Procedures were performed...").
- Avoid disclosing original information not already made public via the financial statements unless required by law.
- Ensure readability: 3â€“4 short paragraphs, avoid jargon where possible.

Maintain a revision block when the draft evolves:

| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-01-08 | `<Name>` | Initial draft based on planning risk assessment |
| 2025-01-12 | `<Name>` | Updated procedures to reflect expanded sample testing |
