# Modified Opinion Library (ISA 705/706)

## Qualified Opinion (Material but Not Pervasive)
- Condition: Identified misstatements are material but not pervasive; or inability to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence is material but not pervasive.
- Basis paragraph template:
  "We were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding {{ area }} because {{ reason }}. Consequently, we were unable to determine whether any adjustments might have been necessary." / "As discussed in Note {{ reference }}, the Company has not {{ correction }}. In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described, the financial statements present fairly…"

- Basis paragraph template:
  "As disclosed in Note {{ reference }}, the Company has not {{ compliance_issue }}, which is a departure from {{ framework }}. In our opinion, because of the significance of this matter, the financial statements do not present fairly…"

## Disclaimer of Opinion (Inability to Obtain Evidence – Material and Pervasive)
- Condition: Unable to obtain evidence; possible effects could be both material and pervasive.
- Basis paragraph template:
  "We were engaged to audit the financial statements… We do not express an opinion because we were not able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding {{ area }} due to {{ reason }}."

## Linkage Notes
- Always reference relevant notes to the financial statements.
- Align wording with ISA 705.A23–.A27, avoiding language that implies an opinion when disclaiming.
- When disclaiming, omit KAMs unless law requires (ISA 705.29).
