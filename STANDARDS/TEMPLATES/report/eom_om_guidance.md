# Emphasis-of-Matter (EOM) and Other-Matter (OM) Guidance (ISA 706)

## Emphasis-of-Matter Paragraph
- Use to draw attention to matters already disclosed in the financial statements that are fundamental to users’ understanding.
- Common triggers: going concern material uncertainty, significant subsequent events with adequate disclosure.
- Structure:
  1. Heading: "Emphasis of Matter"
  2. Reference the note/disclosure.
  3. State that the auditor’s opinion is not modified in respect of the matter.

## Other-Matter Paragraph
- Use to communicate matters not presented or disclosed in the financial statements but relevant to users’ understanding of the audit, auditor’s responsibilities, or auditor’s report.
- Example: component auditor involvement, prior period audited by predecessor.

## Going Concern Material Uncertainty
- ISA 570 requires a specific section labelled "Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern", not an EOM.
- Include when management adequately discloses the uncertainty; ensure wording follows ISA 570.23.

## Checklist
- [ ] Confirm the matter is appropriately disclosed (EOM) or necessary for report-level communication (OM).
- [ ] Ensure concise wording, referencing the specific note.
- [ ] State that the opinion is not modified (EOM) or clarify the context (OM).
- [ ] Verify consistency with jurisdictional requirements.
