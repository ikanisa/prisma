2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill in the details privately
4. Our security team will respond within 48 hours

### 2. Email (if configured)

Send details to: security@prismaglow.com

Include:
- Vulnerability description
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if known)

### 3. Encrypted Communication

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå **Do NOT**:
- Create a public GitHub issue
- Post in Slack or other public channels
- Share exploit details publicly
- Disclose the vulnerability before we've had a chance to fix it

## What Happens Next

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability and severity (1-5 business days)
3. **Fix**: We'll develop and test a fix (timeline depends on severity)
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure with you (responsible disclosure)
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Critical** | Exploitable vulnerability, immediate threat | < 4 hours |
| **High** | Significant security issue | < 24 hours |
| **Medium** | Moderate security concern | < 72 hours |
| **Low** | Minor security improvement | < 1 week |

## Bug Bounty Program
