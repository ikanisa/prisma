## ✅ CONFIDENCE FACTORS

### Why This Will Succeed

1. **Validated Against Real Code**
   - Not based on claims or docs
   - Actual file counts verified
   - LOC measured, not estimated

2. **Conservative Estimates**
   - 80 hours/week per track
   - Built-in buffer time
   - Scope reduced based on reality

3. **Team Has Proven Track**
   - Tax agents: 12/12 complete ✅
   - Audit agents: 11/10 complete ✅
   - Infrastructure: 93/100 ready ✅

4. **Clear Priorities**
   - Only 3 pages to refactor (not 8)
   - 21 agents to build (not 25)
   - No scope creep

5. **Early Wins Available**
   - Week 1: Ship 3 refactored pages
   - Week 1: Ship 8 accounting agents
   - Week 2: Production deployment

## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Documentation Chaos Continues
**Impact:** Team confusion, duplicate work  
**Mitigation:** Track D (3 days, $3,000) fixes this FIRST  
**Status:** Included in revised plan

### Risk 2: Hidden Complexity in Large Pages
**Impact:** Refactoring takes longer than 40 hours  
**Mitigation:** Only 3 pages (not 8), plenty of buffer  
**Status:** LOW RISK

### Risk 3: Agent Implementation Unknowns
**Impact:** Accounting agents harder than expected  
**Mitigation:** Tax/Audit agents provide proven patterns  
**Status:** LOW RISK

### Risk 4: Team Availability
**Impact:** Resources not available Feb 1  
**Mitigation:** Start documentation cleanup NOW (1 person)  
**Status:** MEDIUM RISK - confirm availability
