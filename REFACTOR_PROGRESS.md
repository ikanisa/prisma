# easyMO Fullstack Refactor Progress

## âœ… Completed Phase 1: Foundation & Database

### Database Schema Consolidation
- âœ… Created unified messaging tables (`unified_conversations`, `unified_messages`, `unified_contacts`)
- âœ… Enhanced system metrics table (`system_metrics_enhanced`)
- âœ… Consolidated edge function logs (`edge_function_logs`)
- âœ… Added proper RLS policies and indexes
- âœ… Created updated_at triggers

### Monorepo Structure Setup
- âœ… Created pnpm workspace configuration
- âœ… Set up `packages/lib-core` with shared utilities (auth, error handling, performance monitoring)
- âœ… Set up `packages/types` with TypeScript definitions for edge functions and database
- âœ… Created comprehensive validation schemas using Zod

### Frontend Foundation
- âœ… Created reusable `DataTable` component for admin operations
- âœ… Enhanced `useUnifiedData` hook with new consolidated types
- âœ… Added proper error handling and performance monitoring utilities

## ðŸš§ Next Steps (Phase 2-5)

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Build Packages**: Run `pnpm build` in packages to generate dist files
2. **Update Package.json**: Add workspace dependencies to main package.json
3. **Complete Admin UI Consolidation**: Merge 40+ admin pages into 9 core sections
4. **Edge Functions Refactor**: Move to domain-based structure in `apps/edge/`
5. **Add Testing Infrastructure**: Vitest + Playwright setup
6. **CI/CD Setup**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

### Admin Page Consolidation Plan:
- **Commerce**: Products, Orders, Payments â†’ Single commerce dashboard
- **Mobility**: Trips, Drivers, Passengers â†’ Single mobility dashboard  
- **Listings**: Properties, Vehicles â†’ Single listings dashboard
- **Content**: Documents, Templates â†’ Single content dashboard
- **Ops**: Logs, Metrics, System â†’ Single operations dashboard

### Edge Functions Structure:
```
apps/edge/
â”œâ”€â”€ commerce/ (payment, ordering)
â”œâ”€â”€ mobility/ (trips, driver matching)
â”œâ”€â”€ listings/ (property, vehicle management)
â”œâ”€â”€ messaging/ (WhatsApp, AI agents)
â””â”€â”€ shared/ (utilities, middleware)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics Targets:
- **Performance**: Admin panel <1.5s load, Edge functions <200ms p95
- **Code Quality**: 80%+ test coverage, 0 ESLint errors
- **Security**: All RLS policies implemented, 0 high severity npm audit issues
- **Developer Experience**: <30s build time, comprehensive documentation

## ðŸ”§ Commands to Continue:

```bash
# Build packages
cd packages/lib-core && pnpm build
cd packages/types && pnpm build

# Install workspace dependencies
pnpm install

# Continue with admin page consolidation
# Start with Commerce dashboard integration
```

The foundation is solid - database consolidated, shared libraries created, and TypeScript contracts defined. Ready for Phase 2 implementation!
