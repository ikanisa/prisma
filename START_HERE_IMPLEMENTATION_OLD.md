## 🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS

### What's Complete (65%)
- ✅ Infrastructure (security 92/100, performance optimized)
- ✅ Audit agents (10/10 agents, 2,503 LOC)
- ✅ Database (migrations, RLS, indexes)
- ✅ CI/CD (GitHub Actions, testing)

### What's Outstanding (35%)

- 🔴 Orchestrators (0/3 - 1,950 LOC)
- 🟡 UI/UX (7 components + 4 page refactors)
- 🟡 Gemini AI (6 features)
- 🟡 Desktop app (Tauri)

### Critical Path
```
Tax Agents (Weeks 3-6)
    ↓
Any delay here = project delay
    ↓
Focus: Hire tax SME, daily standups, strict scope
```

---

## ⚠️ TOP 3 RISKS

1. **Tax complexity** (60% probability)
   - Mitigation: Tax SME consultant, 1,000+ test cases, human-in-loop

2. **Timeline slippage** (50% probability)
   - Mitigation: Daily standups, 20% buffer, defer P2 features

3. **Orchestrator coordination** (40% probability)
   - Mitigation: Event sourcing, saga pattern, gradual rollout
