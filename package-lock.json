# 1) Keep the lockfile from the branch that actually contained it
git checkout --ours package-lock.json   # or --theirs, whichever is the real lockfile
git add package-lock.json

# 2) Make sure package.json has the deps you intended
#   (add/confirm these in package.json)
#   "dependencies": {
#     "lucide-react": "^0.544.0",
#     "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2"
#   }

# 3) Regenerate the lockfile from package.json
npm install

# 4) Commit
git commit -m "Resolve lockfile conflict and add lucide-react/jsonwebtoken"
