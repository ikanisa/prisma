# 1) Make sure package.json is the version you actually want (the clean one we finalized).
#    If it's already staged/committed, great â€” move on.

# 2) Drop the conflicted lockfile instead of merging it
git rm --cached package-lock.json
rm -f package-lock.json

# (optional but recommended)
rm -rf node_modules

# 3) Recreate a fresh lockfile from package.json using your current npm
npm install

# 4) Commit
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Regenerate package-lock.json from package.json after merge conflict"
