# Local Validation Summary (2025-03-31)

## Environment
- Node.js: v20.19.4 (per pnpm warning; project now expects 22.12.0)
- pnpm: 9.12.3

## Commands Executed

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm install` | ✅ Success | Reused existing lockfile; warnings about deprecated packages and node engine mismatch. |
| `pnpm typecheck` | ⚠️ Success with warnings | Completed in ~13s; reported unmet peer dependency warnings for `workbox-build` and `workbox-window`. |
| `pnpm lint` | ❌ Failed | ESLint reported 8 errors and 14 warnings across multiple files, including namespace usage, irregular whitespace, missing rule definition, and unexpected console statements. |
| `pnpm build` | ❌ Failed | TypeScript compilation error: `@prisma-glow/api-client` module not found in `apps/gateway/src/routes/v1.ts`. |
| `PORT=3000 pnpm start` | ❌ Failed | Root package lacks a `start` script or `server.js`; application did not launch for PWA smoke test. |

## Additional Checks
- **Supabase service role key exposure:** `rg -i "service[_-]?role"` located only environment-driven references (e.g., `env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`); no literal secrets found in client-facing code or generated bundles.
- **Legacy hosting references:** Historical docs referenced the prior hosting provider; those sections have since been scrubbed in favour of the self-hosted deployment docs.

## Smoke Test
- Admin PWA manifest could not be verified because the application failed to start (`pnpm start` missing). Follow-up required after adding a start script or using the appropriate workspace command (e.g., `pnpm --filter web start`).

## Next Steps
1. Resolve lint errors (namespaces, console usage, irregular whitespace, missing rule definitions).
2. Ensure `@prisma-glow/api-client` dependency is available or adjust import paths to restore `pnpm build`.
3. Provide a root-level start script or document the correct workspace command to enable PWA smoke testing.
4. Re-run lint/build/start and re-attempt PWA manifest verification once blockers are addressed.
