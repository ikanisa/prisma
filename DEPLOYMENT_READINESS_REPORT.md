# Deployment Readiness Report

## Overview
- **Target platform:** Vercel (Node 18)
- **Primary app:** `apps/web` (Next.js 14 App Router)
- **Supporting services:** `apps/gateway` (Express proxy), `services/rag` (RAG/worker service)
- **Package manager:** pnpm 9.12.3 (pinned via `packageManager` field)
- **Node version:** 18.20.4 (enforced via `.nvmrc` and `package.json` engines)

## Inventory Summary
See [`audit/inventory.json`](audit/inventory.json) for the full machine-readable snapshot.

| Workspace | Framework | Build Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/web` | Next.js 14 App Router | `pnpm --filter web build` | Requires Supabase + Keycloak credentials; uses Prisma + NextAuth. |
| `apps/gateway` | Express (TypeScript) | `pnpm --filter @prisma-glow/gateway build` | Proxies API calls to FastAPI and RAG services; tracing via OTEL. |
| `services/rag` | Node workers + Express | `pnpm --filter @prisma-glow/rag-service build` | Long-running RAG orchestrator; not Vercel-friendly, deploy to container runtime. |

## Environment Status
- Full matrix captured in [`audit/env-matrix.csv`](audit/env-matrix.csv).
- App-specific `.env.example` files generated under `apps/web/`, `apps/gateway/`, and `services/rag/` with documentation.
- Runtime validators:
  - `apps/web/src/env.server.ts` + `env.client.ts` guard both server and browser variables.
  - `apps/gateway/src/env.ts` validates required telemetry + upstream configuration and exposes helpers for dynamic overrides.
  - `services/rag/env.ts` enforces core Supabase/OpenAI prerequisites; imported at startup for fail-fast behaviour.
- RAG staging/production manifests now include `OPENAI_FILE_SEARCH_VECTOR_STORE_ID` (plus optional model/max/filter overrides) so hosted file search targets the correct vector store on deploy. Use `pnpm openai:file-search:secrets` to populate GitHub environment secrets in a single step.

## Vercel Deployment Plan
Detailed notes in [`audit/vercel-plan.md`](audit/vercel-plan.md). Key points:
- `apps/web/vercel.json` pins install/build commands (`cd .. && pnpm â€¦`) so monorepo dependencies resolve correctly.
- Preview/production builds use `vercel pull`/`vercel build` with Node 18.
- Gateway and RAG services remain external to Vercel; expose endpoints via configured environment variables.

## CI / Automation
- Added `.github/workflows/vercel-preview-build.yml` to mirror the Vercel preview build locally on PRs.
- Workflow expects `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` secrets.
- Artifacts upload Vercel build logs for triage.
- Local helper script `scripts/vercel-preflight.mjs` automates install + optional `vercel build` to reproduce failures.

## Risks & Follow-ups
- `services/rag` still relies on numerous optional feature flags; ensure downstream infra injects required OpenAI/Supabase secrets before enabling those features.
- Prisma migrations are not executed automatically in the workflow; run `pnpm --filter web prisma:migrate:deploy` during deployment when schema changes.
- When Deployment Protection is enabled, surface `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET` to CI and web app environments.
- Gateway tests mutate runtime env values; dynamic parsing is preserved via helper functions but ensure secrets are injected before scaling to production traffic.

## Status Summary
| Component | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/web` | ðŸŸ¢ Ready | Validated env schema, CI parity, preflight script, Vercel plan in place. |
| `apps/gateway` | ðŸŸ¡ External Deploy | Env validator and docs added; deployment to Vercel requires additional routing decisions. |
| `services/rag` | ðŸŸ¡ External Deploy | Validated core env; keep on container runtime (not Vercel). |
