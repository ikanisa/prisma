## ⚠️ CRITICAL RISKS & MITIGATION

### 🔴 HIGH Priority (Must Address)

**1. Tax Agent Complexity (60% probability, HIGH impact)**
- **Risk:** Multi-jurisdiction tax rules extremely complex
- **Impact:** Agent accuracy <80%, legal liability, delays
- **Mitigation:**
  - Hire tax SME consultant (4 weeks, $15K)
  - Comprehensive test suite (1,000+ test cases)
  - Human-in-the-loop validation (first 6 months)
  - Legal disclaimer: "AI-assisted, requires professional review"
  - Start with P0 agents (EU, US, UK, VAT), defer P2 if needed

**2. Timeline Slippage (50% probability, HIGH impact)**
- **Risk:** Tax agents are 5,250 LOC in 4 weeks = aggressive
- **Impact:** Cascading delays, missed launch, budget overrun
- **Mitigation:**
  - Daily standups, strict scope control
  - 20% buffer built into weeks 7-10
  - Defer P2 features (personal tax, controversy) if needed
  - Weekly executive steering committee for early intervention

**3. Orchestrator Coordination (40% probability, HIGH impact)**
- **Risk:** 47 agents = complex state management, race conditions
- **Impact:** System instability, data corruption, production failures
- **Mitigation:**
  - Event sourcing pattern (audit trail + replay)
  - Saga pattern for long-running workflows
  - Comprehensive integration tests
  - Gradual rollout (1 agent → 3 → 10 → all)
  - Circuit breakers and fallbacks

### 🟡 MEDIUM Priority (Monitor Closely)

**4. Gemini API Rate Limits (30% probability, MEDIUM impact)**
- **Mitigation:** Request 3x quota, aggressive caching, local fallback (Tesseract OCR)

**5. Bundle Size >500KB (30% probability, MEDIUM impact)**
- **Mitigation:** Replace Chart.js (-80KB), Lodash (-50KB), Moment (-40KB), WebP images, PurgeCSS

**6. Knowledge Base Staleness (90% probability, LOW-MEDIUM impact)**
- **Mitigation:** Quarterly review process, RSS feeds, automated alerting, version tracking
