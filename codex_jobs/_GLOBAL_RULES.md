# Global Rules for Codex Jobs (prisma-glow-15)

- YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for completing the task end-to-end, trying multiple safe options if the first fails.
- ADDITIVE-ONLY unless a job explicitly authorizes refactors.
- OBEY agent/policies/ALLOWLIST.json.
- DO NOT LEAK SECRETS (no tokens/keys/.env in logs).
- ALWAYS OPEN A PR with plan, diffs summary, risks, and test results.
- SUPABASE: all schema changes as files in supabase/migrations/.
- If a required tool is missing, propose install steps in the PR body; donâ€™t block execution.
