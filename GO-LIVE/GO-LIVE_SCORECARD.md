**Executive Summary**
- Overall readiness: **ðŸŸ  Amber** â€“ P0 blockers (Pillar Two merge conflict, CSP, CORS) are closed. PWA/a11y artifacts, Sentry dry run, and load-test evidence remain before production sign-off.
- Top 5 risks:
  1. Lighthouse + axe workflow has not been executed yet; artifacts must land in `/GO-LIVE/artifacts/` from CI.
  2. API smoke tests currently exercise stubs only; execute them against staging with real Supabase data before launch.
  3. New storage RLS migration needs staging deployment and a negative direct-download test.
  4. Sentry release tagging dry run has not been executed; PagerDuty/Slack routing still unverified.
  5. Autopilot/document extraction smoke profile needs to run against staging Redis and metrics archived.
- Next 72h priorities:
  1. Execute Lighthouse + axe runs via the new `PWA Audit` workflow and merge the PR artifacts.
  2. Run the API smoke suite against staging and capture the output.
  3. Apply the storage policy migration in staging and confirm unsigned GETs fail.
  4. Perform the Sentry release dry run using the updated playbook and store the evidence.
  5. Run the k6 Autopilot smoke script and archive the summary + dashboards.

| Area | Status | Highlights | Blockers | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend / PWA | ðŸŸ¢ | Manifest ships 192/512 icons; manual service worker precaches the shell; install prompt served via `PWAInstallPrompt`. | Run the `PWA Audit` workflow to generate Lighthouse/axe artifacts. Artifacts are committed to `/GO-LIVE/artifacts` via PR. | `public/manifest.json`, `public/service-worker.js`, `src/utils/pwa.ts`, `.github/workflows/pwa-audit.yml`.
| Backend / API | ðŸŸ¢ | Correlation-ID middleware, CSP/CORS, and API smoke tests (stubs) implemented; lint/build/test/pytest all green. | Run smoke suite against staging with live Supabase credentials. | `server/main.py:60-160`, `tests/api/test_core_smoke.py`, `tests/test_request_id.py`.
| Database / Supabase | ðŸŸ  | Documents bucket now gated by storage policies; existing RLS migrations intact. | Apply the new migration in staging and perform a negative download test. | `supabase/migrations/20250927100000_documents_storage_policy.sql`, `tests/test_documents_signing.py`.
| Auth & RBAC | ðŸŸ  | JWT verification + role hierarchy unchanged; assistant dock respects RBAC. | Remove verbose auth logs & add JWT claim tests (scheduled for P2). | `server/main.py:242-344`, `src/components/auth/protected-route.tsx:16-79`.
| Security & Privacy | ðŸŸ¢ | CSP + strict CORS enforced, cookie consent + privacy notice implemented, doc signing verified. | Execute Lighthouse/axe + consent screenshot workflow to capture evidence. | `server/main.py:60-160`, `.env.example`, `SECURITY.md`, `src/components/privacy/CookieConsent.tsx`, `.github/workflows/pwa-audit.yml`.
| Observability & Ops | ðŸŸ  | Request IDs reach logs/Sentry; runbooks updated with release tagging workflow. | Execute Sentry/PagerDuty dry run and capture evidence. | `server/main.py:60-127`, `docs/observability.md`, `GO-LIVE/RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md`.
| Quality & Testing | ðŸŸ¢ | Vitest + pytest suites pass; new Playwright a11y suite and bundle budgets enforced in CI. | Run Lighthouse/axe via `PWA Audit` workflow when needed. | `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test`, `pytest`, `scripts/check_bundlesize.mjs`, `tests/playwright/a11y.spec.ts`.

**Stop-Ship (P0) list**
- All P0 remediation items implemented; confirm staging validations (Lighthouse, API smoke, storage enforcement) before opening production traffic.
