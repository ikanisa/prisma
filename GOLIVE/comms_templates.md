## Launch Notes (Internal)
Subject: Agent launch – standards-ready release

Hi team,

We are live with the compliance-ready agent rollout. Key highlights:
- Traceability matrix completed (50+ rows) with checklist linkage.
- Red-team scenarios passed (see `STANDARDS/SAFETY/red_team_cases.md`).
- Performance targets within thresholds (details in `/PERF/targets.md`).

Next steps: monitor telemetry dashboard hourly for the first day. Report anomalies to Ops.

Thanks,
Operations Director
