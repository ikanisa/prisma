## 1. Scorecard Summary
| Pillar | Score (0-5) | Trend | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 4 | â–² | CSP/CORS hardened across FastAPI gateway with mandatory trusted hosts and Sentry telemetry initialised for every request. |
| Reliability | 4 | â–² | Request tracing middleware and release-control evaluations run on every build, ensuring regression gates are continuously enforced. |
| Observability | 4 | â–² | Request telemetry spans exported with service metadata and version tagging for Sentry/OTel ingestion. |
| Performance | 3 | â–² | Offline queue retries capped with exponential backoff and service worker background sync to de-risk burst workloads. |
| Maintainability | 4 | â–² | Release runbook, automation jobs, and modular storage wrappers centralise change management across services. |
| Compliance | 4 | â–² | Document storage policies and release-control evidence codified for ledger-grade traceability. |

**Overall Readiness:** 3.8 / 5 (â†‘ from 3.0) â€“ Trending GREEN after remediating prior stop-ship items.

## 2. Mitigation Status
- âœ… **S0-001 â€“ Request Telemetry Coverage**: FastAPI now wraps each request with `RequestTelemetryMiddleware`, exporting trace IDs and release metadata to downstream sinks, closing the observability gap identified in the last audit.
- âœ… **S0-002 â€“ Release Control Drift**: The `evaluate_release_controls` workflow is executed during readiness checks, blocking deployments when environment preconditions fail.
- âœ… **S1-004 â€“ Offline Sync Robustness**: Background sync routines persist queue state in IndexedDB with deterministic retries, preventing data loss during offline submissions.
- ðŸŸ¡ **S1-008 â€“ Incident Drill Evidence**: Sentry release tagging and PagerDuty routing dry run scheduled for 2025-11-06; awaiting attached evidence.
- ðŸŸ  **S0-005 â€“ Secret Management Runbook**: Drafted handoff notes, final production rotation walkthrough pending CISO sign-off.
- ðŸŸ  **S2-011 â€“ Storage Policy Backfill**: Migration applied in staging but negative download test still pending sign-off.

## 3. Architecture Updates Since Last Review
1. **Gateway Telemetry Upgrade** â€“ Application bootstrap configures OTEL tracer, service version tagging, and Sentry SDK initialisation guarded by environment-aware toggles.
2. **Release Controls Enforcement** â€“ Readiness endpoint now surfaces structured release-control checks, feeding governance dashboards while blocking non-compliant deployments.
3. **PWA Offline Resilience** â€“ Service worker and client queue modules share retry semantics, ensuring offline submissions are retried with bounded backoff and durable IndexedDB storage.
4. **Ledger Integrity Automation** â€“ Background jobs sanitise journal ledgers before ingestion, reducing manual reconciliation time.

## 4. Recommendations
1. Complete Sentry/PagerDuty dry run and attach outputs to `/GO-LIVE/artifacts/2025-11-06/` before go-live.
2. Execute Supabase negative download test with staging credentials and archive logs under `/GO-LIVE/artifacts/storage/`.
3. Capture Lighthouse + axe runs using the updated workflow and store JSON reports alongside bundle hashes.
4. Schedule quarterly ledger integrity verification using the sanitiser job outputs as baseline evidence.
