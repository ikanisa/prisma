# 🚀 START HERE - IMPLEMENTATION 2025
## Prisma Glow - Complete Implementation Guide

**Last Updated:** January 28, 2025  
**Status:** Post Deep Review - Ready for Execution  
**Reading Time:** 3 minutes

---

## 📖 WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

You asked for a deep review of all implementation documentation. Here's what we found:

### The Problem
- **150+ conflicting documents** scattered across the repo
- **3 different implementation plans** with different timelines
- **Documentation claimed 0% tax agents** but code showed 100% complete!
- **No verified performance metrics** (claims vs reality unknown)

### The Solution
We conducted a comprehensive deep review and created:

1. **Single source of truth** - Consolidated implementation plan
2. **Ground truth verification** - Actual codebase status
3. **Clear 8-week timeline** - Two-track parallel execution
4. **Budget clarity** - $412K core, +$77K optional desktop

## 🚨 COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q: Why do we need Week 0?
**A:** Documentation claimed one thing (0% tax agents), code showed another (100%). We need to verify actual state before planning remaining work.

### Q: Why two tracks?
**A:** Agent implementation (backend) and UI optimization (frontend) are independent. Parallel execution saves 4 weeks.

### Q: What happened to all the other plans?
**A:** 150+ docs created confusion. We consolidated into ONE plan based on ground truth. Old docs archived to `docs/archive/pre-consolidation-2025/`.

### Q: Can we skip verification?
**A:** No. We need actual measurements (bundle size, coverage, lighthouse) not guesses. Week 0 gives us the baseline.

### Q: What if verification shows different numbers?
**A:** We'll adjust the plan based on ground truth. That's the point! Better to know now than discover issues in Week 4.

### Q: Is $412K accurate?
**A:** Yes, based on 9 people × 8 weeks + infrastructure + 10% contingency. See detailed breakdown in executive briefing.

### Q: What about the desktop app?
**A:** Optional Phase 2. Recommend launching web platform first, validating with users, then investing in desktop.
